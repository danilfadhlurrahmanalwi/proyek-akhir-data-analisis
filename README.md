#### Project Description
This project was a final assignment for the Data Analysis with Python module. In this project, I conducted data analysis using Python to identify the specific days and times when bicycle rentals were most frequent. The results showed that bicycle usage peaked on weekdays, during working hours, and in clear weather conditions. After completing the analysis and obtaining the insights, I deployed the results using Streamlit. The Streamlit application presents a report summarizing the analysis based on hourly and daily data, making it easier to understand the peak, low, and moderate bicycle rental periods.

## Create Virtual Environment Using Pipenv
### Setup Environment - Shell/Terminal
1. Open the Terminal or PowerShell.
2. Create a new folder named proyek_akhir_data_analisis by running the following command:
- mkdir proyek_akhir_data_analisis
3. Navigate to the newly created folder using the following command:
- cd proyek_akhir_data_analisis
4. Create a virtual environment by running the following command:
- pipenv install
5. Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:
- pipenv shell
6. Install all the required libraries by running the following command:
- pip install numpy pandas scipy matplotlib seaborn jupyter

## Install Dependencies (Libraries)
### Install all libraries at once using CMD with the following command:
- pip install pandas streamlit seaborn numpy matplotlib

## Running Streamlit Dashboard
### Run the following command in CMD:
- streamlit run main.py
